## Local Run

The following image shows that building and running the container locally worked seamlessly.

## GitHub Actions

The following GitHub Actions file is my solution for the given exercise. It was quite some work to get Trivy to work in such a way that it was given. Now I run the Trivy vulnerability scanner thrice, once for the Dockerfile, a second time for the repositorys source files and a third time for the infrastructure code. The Image gets tagged with a short version of the commit sha and pushed only if it builds correctly.

```yml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

```
Some example runs of the GitHub Actions workflow above are visible beneath. The most interesting part is the (1) that is highlighted.

![GitHub Actions Successful Run](./Exercise%204.3.png)

Instead of outputting the result of the vulnerability scanning in the console of the Action, I create `sarif`-files, which can be integrated in GitHub's Security Tab as shown in the next two screenshots. This is quite a neat feature.

## Docker Hub Deployment

The following screenshot shows that the Deployment to Dockerhub worked perfectly. Instead of specifying a password, I created a secret token. The Docker Hub URL is: https://hub.docker.com/u/bemayr
